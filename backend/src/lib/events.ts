/**
 * events.ts
 *
 * Pure decoders for Soroban contract events (see docs/EVENTS.md).
 *
 * An event's `topic[0]` is a `Symbol` carrying the event name (e.g.
 * `milestone_released`), `topic[1]` is the struct field annotated `#[topic]`,
 * and `value` is a map of the remaining fields keyed by field name. These
 * helpers never throw — malformed events decode to `null`/`{}` and are ignored
 * by the indexer rather than crashing it.
 *
 * The two-places-the-id-lives split matters: `created` and `funded` have
 * `client` as their `#[topic]` field, so their `escrow_id` is in the data map,
 * while `milestone_released`, `dispute_opened`, `resolved`, `refunded`,
 * `raised`, `dispute_resolved` and `rated` carry `escrow_id` as the topic field
 * and *not* in the data map. Use `eventEscrowId` rather than reading
 * `escrow_id` off the data map.
 * `milestone_released`), and its `value` is a map of the remaining fields keyed
 * by field name. These helpers never throw — malformed events decode to
 * `null`/`{}` and are ignored by the indexer rather than crashing it.
 *
 * `#[topic]` fields are the trap (see docs/EVENTS.md): a struct field marked
 * `#[topic]` is serialized into `topic[1]`, not into `value`, and every event in
 * this project except escrow's `created`/`funded` carries `escrow_id` there. A
 * handler that reads only `value` therefore sees no escrow id at all and
 * silently skips the event, which is why `decodeEventFields` exists.
